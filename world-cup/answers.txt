Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: As the number of simulations increased, the predictions became more accurate and did not prove to be incorrect.

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: This would depend on the specific application and the cost of compute time. A cost-benefit analysis would need to be performed to determine at what point the cost of additional simulations outweighs the benefit of more accurate predictions.
